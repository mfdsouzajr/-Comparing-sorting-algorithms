# Comparing sorting algorithms

Hi. I will show some screenshots that will facilitate the understanding of each step of application.

## Step 1: Enter how many integers will be created for the array of each case.

As shown in the screenshot below, the user typed 10. That means that 10 numbers will be created for the array of each case.

## Step 2: View the array of each case.

The application will create the array of each case:

• **Best Case array:** a random vector containing positive integers in ascending order.

• **Medium Case array:** a random vector containing positive integers in scrambled order.

• **Worst Case array:** a random vector containing positive integers in decreasing order.

The range of possible numbers for each array depends on the number of elements the user has entered. For example, if the user typed 10, the range of possible numbers will be from 1 to 10.

## Step 3: Choose a numeric option from the "Options Menu".

Each numeric option represents a type of sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithms selected for this small application were:

• **Bubble Sort**

• **Insertion Sort**

• **Quick Sort**

What if the user enters a nonexistent option as shown in the screenshot below?

![Step 3](https://github.com/marcosFDSjunior/-Comparing-sorting-algorithms/blob/master/Application%20screenshots/09.PNG)

Well... 
In that case, the user will receive a message saying that the operation is invalid and the "Options Menu" will appear again until the user enters a valid numeric option.

## Step 4: View the runtimes obtained to put the array of each case in ascending order.

When the user finally enters a valid option, that is, choosing an ordering algorithm, the application will show the Runtime taken to put the array of each case in ascending order, as shown in the screenshot below:

![Step 4](https://github.com/marcosFDSjunior/-Comparing-sorting-algorithms/blob/master/Application%20screenshots/11.PNG)

Note that the time shown is in the following format: *hh:mm:ss.fffffff*.

• *hh* -> Hours

• *mm* -> Minutes

• *ss* -> Seconds

• *fffffff* -> Fractions of seconds

#### Final words

That's it, guys. This extremely simple application served as the basis for one of my university studies involving sorting algorithms. I hope you liked it! Bye.
